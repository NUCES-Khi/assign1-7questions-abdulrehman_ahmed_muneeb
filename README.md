## Q1
Ans::
The theological objection regarding consciousness and the mathematical objection regarding creativity still carry weight.
Turing's refutations are valid within the context of his arguments, but they remain debated in philosophical and ethical circles.
New objections include concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical implications of AI's perception and inference capabilities.
No, Turing's prediction appears overly optimistic given the complexities of human language understanding, and no AI system has convincingly passed a Turing Test under rigorous conditions.

## Q2
Ans::
**Playing table tennis:** Current AI struggles with the dynamic nature and physical dexterity required for real-time gameplay so this would not be possible.
**Driving in Karachi:** Fully autonomous driving faces challenges in navigating unpredictable traffic patterns and interpreting local driving norms safely this would not be possible.
**Playing bridge competitively:** AI lacks the advanced reasoning and collaboration skills necessary for competitive play due to the game's complexity.
**Writing funny stories:** AI struggles to understand and generate nuanced humor, cultural references, and unexpected twists.
**Real-time translation between English and Urdu:** AI faces challenges in accurately capturing nuances(minor differences) and idiomatic expressions for real-time spoken language translation.This has been possible to some extent.

## Q3
Ans::
**Agent for Football Environment**
**Environment Characteristics:**
**Accessible:** The agent has access to the entire football field through sensors and cameras, enabling it to perceive the positions of players, the ball, and other relevant elements.
**Deterministic:** The outcome of actions in the football environment follows known rules governing player movements and scoring. While there may be some elements of randomness (e.g., player decisions), overall, the environment is deterministic.
**Episodic:** Matches in football are episodic events, with each match having a clear beginning (kick-off) and end (final whistle). The agent's performance is evaluated based on the outcome of each match (win, lose, or draw).
**Dynamic:** The football environment is not static but it is highly dynamic, with players constantly moving, passing, and tackling. This dynamic nature requires real-time decision-making from the agent as it navigates the changing game state.
**Continuous:** Actions in the football environment occur in real-time without discrete time steps. Players move continuously across the field, and actions such as dribbling, passing, and tackling happen seamlessly without distinct intervals.
A hybrid agent architecture combining reactive, deliberative, and learning components is best suited for the football domain.

## Q4
Ans::
**Playing soccer:**
Performance Measure: Winning matches, scoring goals, effective teamwork.
Environment: Soccer field with players, goals, ball, and referees.
Actuators: Legs for running, kicking, and passing; feet for ball control.
Sensors: Eyes(Cameras) for perceiving the field, opponents, and ball; ears(Sensors) for referee calls.

**Exploring the subsurface of Arabian Sea:**
Performance Measure: Mapping underwater terrain, discovering marine life.
Environment: Arabian Sea with varying depths, currents, and marine life.
Actuators: Submersible vehicles, robotic arms for sampling.
Sensors: Sonar for navigation, cameras for imaging, sensors for water parameters.

**Shopping for used AI books on the Internet:**
Performance Measure: Finding desired books at reasonable prices.
Environment: Online marketplace with listings of AI books.
Actuators: Mouse and keyboard for navigation and selection.
Sensors: Monitor for viewing listings, mouse for clicking and scrolling.

**Playing a tennis match:**
Performance Measure: Winning points, games, and sets.
Environment: Tennis court with net, rackets, ball, and opponents.
Actuators: Arms for serving, forehand, backhand, and volleying.
Sensors: Eyes(camera) for tracking ball trajectory, ears(sensor) for opponent's shots.

**Practicing tennis against a wall:**
Performance Measure: Improving accuracy, timing, and technique.
Environment: Tennis court with a wall as the rebound surface.
Actuators: Racket for hitting the ball against the wall.
Sensors: Eyes(camera) for tracking ball trajectory, ears(sensor) for ball impact.

## Q5
Ans::
1.True:
An agent sensing partial information cannot be perfectly rational because it may not have all necessary data to make the optimal decision.

2.True:
Some task environments may require consideration of past or future states, making pure reflex agents unable to behave rationally in all situations.

3.False:
Not every task environment allows for rational behavior from every agent due to limitations in information or computational abilities.

4.False:
The input to an agent program may include additional information beyond what the agent function requires, making them different.

6.False:
Randomly selecting actions may not lead to rational behavior in deterministic environments where certain actions yield better results than others.
